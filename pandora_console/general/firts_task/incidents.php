			For it, the Pandora FMS team has designed an incident manager within which any user is able to open incidents, 
			explaining what's happened on the network and to update them with comments and files any time in case there is a need to do so.
			This system allows the users to work as a team, along with different roles and work-flow systems which allows an incident to be 
			moved from one group to another, and that members from different groups and different people could work on the same incident, sharing information and files.
