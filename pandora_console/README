What is Pandora FMS
-------------------

Pandora watches your systems and applications, and allows you to know the status of any element of those systems. Pandora could detect a 
network interface down, a defacement in your website, a memory leak in one of your server app, or the movement of any value of the NASDAQ 
new technology market. If you want, Pandora could send out SMS message when your systems fails... or when Google's value drop below US$ 33.

Pandora will adjust, like an octopus, to your systems and requirements, because has been designed to be open, modular, multiplattform and 
easy to customize and use, all integrated into a scalable and distributed architecture.

Pandora runs on any operating system, with specific agents for each platform gathering data and sending it to a server, it has specific 
agents for GNU/Linux, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, BSD/IPSO, and Windows 2000, XP and 2003.

Pandora can also monitor any kind of TCP/IP service, without the need to install agents, and monitor network systems such as load 
balancers, routers, switches, operating systems, applications, or simply printers if you need. Pandora also supports SNMP for collecting 
data and for receiving traps.

A few examples of common resources monitored by Pandora could be processor load, disk and memory usage, running processes, log files, 
environmental factors such as temperature, or application values like strings contained in web pages or any possible way to collect data in 
an automatic way.
