Requirements
============

You need MD5 package to run Pandora Agent for HPUX with Data Integrity (this is now optional). In this package was included a binary file for HPUX 11, dynamically compiled. If you dont want to install external binary files, please dont use checksum feature.
MD5 pakage was created by RSA Data Security <jte@cert.org>, and distributed under the terms of GPL licence.
There are versions for HPUX 10.20, and source available at http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/hppd/hpux/Sysadmin/md5-1.00/


Install MD5 package
===================

Pandora Agent for HPUX already has md5 inside, in ./util directory, if you need to install md5 for HPUX 10.x please unpack md5 binary in ./util directory (replacing v11 version).


SSH Key generation procedure (F-Secure SSH only)
================================================

When porting a SSH Key from HPUX F-Secure SSH implementation you need to convert from IETF format to OpenSSH format. This could be done using converting utility from Linux OpenSSH implementation:

ssh-keygen -i -f file_ietf_pubkey
