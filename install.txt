Installation:

Requires a Web Server (Apache recommended) with PHP 4.3.x (or higher but PHP 5 Not tested yet), 
PHP4-MySQL and PHP4-session modules, PHP-GD v1.3 library 
and JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) for graphic generation.

Database

You need a database with name "pandora". 
To create the structure of Pandora database in MySQL Server you have the SQL script pandoradb.sql.
It creates tables and indexes needed to insert information into Pandora database.

You MUST populate database with pandoradb_data.sql,
an SQL script that inserts data needed to run Web Console and default user (login: admin, pass: pandora)
to access Pandora Web Console.

To install the files, first create a database called "pandora", 
and set an user to be able to access this database:

mysql> create database pandora;

Later, execute the next commands using a user with enough privileges to create tables and indexes
into Pandora Database into your MySQL Server:

cat pandoradb.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p
cat pandoradb_data.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p

Note: if your system is Windows, use the command type instead of cat.

You can also use the source command, if you are connected to MySQL, from the MySQL prompt:

mysql> use pandora;
mysql> source <path_to_pandoradb.sql>
mysql> source <path_to_pandoradb_data.sql>

This example is valid using root user in MySQL.
Remember if you're in Windows and you use MySQL v4.1, use the dobule slash ("//") with the path to the files,
not the backslash ("\").

If you have any problem with this commands, from the OS command line you can run this commands:

cat pandoradb.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p
cat pandoradb_data.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p

Note: if you're using Windows, you must use type command instead of the cat one.

Now we will create an user "pandora" and will be given to it privileges from the localhost:

mysql> grant all on pandora.* to 'pandora'@'localhost' identified by 'pandora';

Keep in mind that users need access from Pandora WEB Console and from Pandora Server,
if your deployment has many subcomponents in different physical machines,
you need to setup a MySQL user with privileges to access from different locations.

If you get the error "Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect]: client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading"
when authenticating Web Console, you have to change the way the password is stored into the database (see FAQ):

mysql> set password for 'pandora'@'localhost' = old_password('pandora');

Please note this user will be used by several Pandora subcomponents(Pandora Server, Pandora Web Console) to access database.

Configuration:

The only file you need to modify is include/config.php, where the following variables are included in .php code:
$dbname="pandora";   // name of database for pandora (default: pandora)
$dbuser="pandora";   // mysql user to access pandora database
$dbpassword="pandora";   // Password for mysql user to access pandora database
$dbhost="pandora";   // Hostname or IP where mySQL server runs

If database is defined and was correctly installed, you can now access:
http://<hostname_pandora_webconsole>:<port>/<installation_directory>/index.php

The first time you log there is a default admin user "admin" and password "pandora".
It's worth to say that you MUST CHANGE CREDENTIALS BEFORE LOGIN FIRST TIME,
change it or create another account, disabling this one.
